    <h2>Music</h2>

    <h3 style="text-align: center; color: white; font-weight: bold;">💫 Maram's Top 5 Favorite Artists 💫</h3>


    <p><strong>1. Conan Gray:</strong> Conan is an American singer-songwriter who first rose to fame on YouTube before
      releasing his breakout hit Heather. Known for writing heart-wrenching songs about love, loneliness, and identity,
      Conan's music blends bedroom pop with raw, emotional lyricism — something that clearly resonates with Maram.<br>
      <span class="quote">Fun Fact: Before his music career took off, Conan used to make vlogs and write poetry — he's
        been creative since he was a kid.</span>
    </p>
    <img src="attached_assets/image_1750492450898.png" alt="Conan Gray" style="max-width: 300px; border-radius: 10px; margin: 1rem 0;" />

    <p><strong>2. Sombr:</strong> Sombr is a lesser-known but deeply emotional artist whose music explores
      vulnerability, heartbreak, and longing. With a voice that sounds like it's carrying the weight of everything
      unsaid, Sombr's songs strike a chord with people who overthink, overfeel, and fall too hard.<br>
      <span class="quote">Fun Fact: Though not mainstream, Sombr's cult following comes from TikTok and late-night
        playlists — people find their way to his songs when they need comfort.</span>
    </p>
    <img src="attached_assets/image_1750492519799.png" alt="Sombr" style="max-width: 300px; border-radius: 10px; margin: 1rem 0;" />

    <p><strong>3. bbno$:</strong> Pronounced baby no money, bbno$ is a Canadian rapper and internet personality known
      for his playful lyrics and infectious beats. His music is the complete opposite of sad boy pop — it's loud,
      chaotic, and fun — proving Maram has RANGE.<br>
      <span class="quote">Fun Fact: He originally studied kinesiology and planned to be a physiotherapist before turning
        to music full-time!</span>
    </p>
    <img src="attached_assets/image_1750492544705.png" alt="bbno$" style="max-width: 300px; border-radius: 10px; margin: 1rem 0;" />

  

    <p><strong>4. Gracie Abrams:</strong> Gracie's soft voice and honest songwriting have made her a favorite among
      indie pop fans. Her lyrics often feel like pages from a diary — introspective, tender, and painfully relatable.
      She's part of the new wave of singer-songwriters who turn vulnerability into art.<br>
      <span class="quote">Fun Fact: Gracie is the daughter of film director J.J. Abrams (yep — Star Wars and Star Trek)
        but carved her own path in music.</span>
    </p>

    <img src="attached_assets/image_1750492621019.png" alt="Gracie Abrams" style="max-width: 300px; border-radius: 10px; margin: 1rem 0;" />
    
    

    <p><strong>5. Olivia Rodrigo:</strong> Known for drivers license, good 4 u, and her GRAMMY-winning debut album SOUR,
      Olivia is the voice of Gen Z heartbreak. Her blend of emotional ballads and pop-punk anthems make her a must on
      any heartbreak playlist — which Maram obviously vibes with.<br>
      <span class="quote">Fun Fact: Olivia was inspired by Taylor Swift and Lorde, and often writes her lyrics in one go
        — she calls it "purging" her feelings into her songs.</span>
    </p>

 <h2 style="text-align: center; color: white; font-weight: bold;">📚Maram's Favorite Books 📚</h2>


    <p><strong>1. No Longer Human – Osamu Dazai</strong></p>
    <img src="attached_assets/download (6)_1750484852785.png" alt="No Longer Human book cover" />


    <p><strong>Backstory:</strong><br>
      No Longer Human follows Ōba Yōzō, a man who feels completely disconnected from society and struggles to present a
      false, cheerful persona to mask his inner emptiness. Told through a series of notebooks, the novel explores his
      descent into isolation, addiction, and despair a haunting reflection of alienation in modern life.</p>

    <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong><br>
      This book is considered semi-autobiographical and is often seen as Osamu Dazai’s personal farewell he died by
      suicide shortly after it was published in 1948.</p>

    <p><strong>2. Crime and Punishment – Fyodor Dostoevsky</strong></p>
    <img src="attached_assets/download (4)_1750484852786.png" alt="Crime and Punishment book cover" />

      Set in 19th-century St. Petersburg, the novel follows Rodion Raskolnikov, a poor former student who believes he’s
      above moral law. He murders a pawnbroker, thinking it will benefit society but the guilt slowly consumes him. The
      story dives into psychological torment, redemption, and the weight of conscience.</p>

    <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong><br>
      Dostoevsky wrote this while battling severe debt and gambling addiction some say he infused Raskolnikov with his
      own inner conflicts.</p>

    <p><strong>3. White Nights – Fyodor Dostoevsky</strong></p>

      woman waiting for her lost love. Over four nights, they connect deeply but reality interrupts their fleeting
      romance. It’s a bittersweet tale of unspoken love, hope, and heartbreak.</p>

    <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong><br>
      Despite being one of Dostoevsky’s shorter works, White Nights remains a favorite for its emotional simplicity and
      it was later adapted into multiple films, including an Italian version by Luchino Visconti.</p>

    <p>My dear Maram,</p>
    <p>I hope you’re reading this during a calm moment. when things are quiet and you can just take a breath, relax, and
      feel a little peace.
      I’ve been thinking about you a lot… probably more than I should admit. But then again, you’ve always had that
      effect on me. There’s just something about you. Idk maybe it’s your quiet strength, or the way your laugh feels
      like it holds everything together. Whatever it is, it sticks with me, no matter how far or how long we’ve been
      apart.</p>

    <p>I keep thinking about us. Not just the smiles and those little looks we used to share, but the peace in our
      silence, the honesty in just being near each other. That closeness didn’t need words. It felt real, it was real.
      And I still hold onto those memories like a photo I never want to lose.</p>

    <p>There are things I’ve been meaning to say. Things I didn’t know how to say when we were standing face to face.
      But here, in writing, I’ll try.</p>

    <p>You’ve always been the kind of person who makes me want to be better kinder, stronger, more open. Not because you
      ever asked for that, but because you deserve it. You deserve someone who sees the best in you and wants to walk
      beside you with patience and love. And I just hope that, even on the quietest days, you know how deeply you’re
      loved.</p>

    <p>I carry you with me every day. Not as something heavy, but like a guide. Thinking of you calms me, reminds me of
      who I am when I’m with you, and gives me hope. Even if I don’t always say the right thing, I need you to know that
      you’ve left a part of yourself with me that I’ll never let go of.</p>

    <p>And I hope, no matter where life takes us, we both always know that I’m yours.</p>

    <p>In all the quiet, simple, real ways that matter.</p>

    <p>With all my love,<br>
      Always yours,<br>
      Mahmoud</p>
